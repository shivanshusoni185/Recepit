To develop a reporting utility for generating customized PDF and XLSX reports, follow these steps in a professional manner:

1. Install Python 3.9 and the Django framework. You can use IDEs like VSCode or PyCharm for development.
2. Create a folder for your project. Open the folder in your preferred IDE.
3. Install additional libraries required for the project, including boto3, requests, and reportlab. Use the following commands:
   - pip install django
   - pip install boto3
   - pip install reportlab
   - pip install requests

4. Initialize your Django project using the following command:
   - django-admin startproject Name_of_project

5. Update the project's settings in the settings.py file:
   - Add the name of your project to INSTALLED_APPS.
   - Update the TEMPLATES directory to include the path to your template folder.

6. If you intend to upload files to an AWS S3 bucket, configure the AWS settings in the settings.py file as well. Otherwise, you can skip this step.

7. Define your database models in the models.py file. Specify the required fields for your database.

8. Register your models in the admin.py file using admin.site.register(Name_of_model), replacing "Name_of_model" with the appropriate model name.

9. Perform migrations to create the database tables. Use the following commands:
   - python manage.py makemigrations Name_of_project (replace "Name_of_project" with your project name)
   - python manage.py migrate

10. Define the URL paths for your application in the urls.py file.

11. Implement the custom logic for report generation in the views.py file. Create functions that handle the retrieval of data from various sources, generate the reports, and customize them based on user input.

12. Connect the functions in views.py with the corresponding URLs in the urls.py file.

13. Start the development server using the following command:
    - python manage.py runserver

This structure and configuration will provide you with a foundation to develop a reporting utility using Python with the Django framework. Remember to implement additional functionalities and customize the solution according to your specific requirements.
